# Two Sample Testing

## Testing Difference in Population Mean
Questions to ask:
* Dependent or Independent Samples? 

Dependent
: individuals from one sample are used to determine the individuals in the other sample
: matched pairs samples

Independent
: individuals from one sample do not control selection of individuals for the other sample

Pro tip: if the size of sample one is different from the size of sample two, the samples must be independent. Why? There isn't
a way to match each item in the sample with a partner. 

### Dependent Samples
 
 The Paired T Test 
 
 Conditions: 
 * dependent samples
 * the differences in population data are normally distriuted or the sample size is greater than 30
