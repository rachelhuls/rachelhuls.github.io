I was introduced to R during my last year in undergrad through DAT 502 and DAT 530. Check out the course descriptions:

> DAT 502. Introduction to Statistical Computation.
>
> Explore the use of various statistical software packages, such as SAS, SPSS, and R. Topics will be selected from construction of data set, descriptive analysis, regression analysis, analysis of design experiment, multivariate analysis, categorical data analysis, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, and presentation of data in graphic forms.

> DAT 530. Advanced Statistical Methods.
>
> Topics include multiple linear regression, statistical inferences for regression model, diagnostics and remedies for multicollinearity, outlier and influential cases, model selection, logistic regression, multivariate analysis, categorical data analysis, discriminant analysis, cluster analysis.

DAT 530 emphasized the mathematical concepts underlying various machine learning algorithms. Lessons focused on theory, while assignments focused on the applying algorithms. For the latter, I used RStudio Notebooks which presents my code, results, and interpretation all in a single document. Assignments often included data visualization, predictive and descriptive statistics, parameter tuning, model training and predictions.

Here are the textbooks used during these courses:
  * Learning Base R by Leemis
  * An Introduction to Statistical Learning 2nd edition by James et al.
