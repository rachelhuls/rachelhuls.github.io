title: Seven Principles of da Vinci
tags: daVinci

I recently read a portion of *How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci* by Michael J. Gelb. He's compiled the philosophy 
behind da Vinci into 7 ideas that we can implement every day.

1. Curiositá - question everything. 
2. Dimostrazione - learn through experience.
3. Sensazione - practice with all of your senses.  
4. Sfumato - don't let the possibility of failure hold you back. 
5. Arte/Scienza - learn to balance art and science in life and learning. 
6. Corporalitá - work the body as well as the mind. 
7. Connessione - every single thing is connected. 

I discovered the importance of several principles before reading this book. Yet, the book is much better 
at putting them into words. I hope to read all of his notebooks some day. It may be of more use to write my own though.
This website encapsulates my notes as da Vinci did his.
