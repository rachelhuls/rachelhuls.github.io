I am thrilled with the opportunity to share my research during STARS. For the last year, I have served as a research assistant to Dr. Huang, a professor of computer science at UIS. More details about our research can be found in the STARS [Program of Abstracts](#https://uofi.box.com/s/eez7ayfs1t4l54ge49lbkeqd7lwp4oxu).
