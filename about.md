Rachel is a university student, dog-lover, and curiosity enthusiast. I've always said I wish I could be a student forever. For the longest time, I intended that comment to be about the formal education system. Costs are a barrier to formal training and especially long term. So I explore and learn as a key feautre of my everyday life. Welcome to my journey!
